ArcanaCards are minted in groups called \'Topics\', which all have a unique code so you can\'t
 guess their hidden message. The topic indicators are shown on the top right of each topic.
 The indicators are:\n
\n* M nnnK nnnL nnnT\n
\n* You can read the hidden message (short-press on the topic to read the message),\n
\nM You have scanned the message code,\n
\nnnnK How many keys you have for this topic (nnn is some number),\n
\nnnnL How many locks are on the message. To unlock a hidden message you need the message and this many keys (nnn is some number),\n
\nnnnT The total number of keys that were made for this message (nnn is some number).\n
\n
\nYou can long-press on a topic to access other topic-related options), but to get
 started press the NEW button to create your first topic!
    </string>

    <string name="text_howto_new">
\'Keys\' are the number of codes that will be created.\n
\n\'Locks\' are the number of keys that must be scanned to reveal your hidden message.\n
\n\'Clues\' can be attached to keys and can be read as soon as a key is scanned.\n
 Choose clues that create an interesting game mechanic, ie. the locations of other keys or
 portions of a text. Use the menu autofill options to get started with some quote-based
 games from some public domain texts.
    </string>

    <string name="text_features_limitedversion">
This version of ArcanaCard is restricted to 7 keys, 3 locks and 20 character
 messages and clues.</string>
