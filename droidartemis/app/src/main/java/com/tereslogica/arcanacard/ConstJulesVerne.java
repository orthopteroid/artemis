            "*", "Jules Verne: If I looked towards the west, the ocean lay before me in all its majestic grandeur, a continuation as it were, of these fleecy hilltops.", "Jules Verne: 1864",
            "*", "Jules Verne: I became intoxicated with a sense of lofty sublimity, without thought of the abysses into which my daring was soon about to plunge me.", "Jules Verne: 1864",
            "*", "Jules Verne: But Heaven never sends unmixed grief, and for Professor Liedenbrock there was a satisfaction in store proportioned to his desperate anxieties.", "Jules Verne: 1864",
            "*", "Jules Verne: How many prisoners in solitary confinement become idiots, if not mad, for want of exercise for the thinking faculty!", "Jules Verne: 1864",
            "*", "Jules Verne: To describe my despair would be impossible. No words could tell it. I was buried alive, with the prospect before me of dying of hunger and thirst.", "Jules Verne: 1864",
            "*", "Jules Verne: Science, my lad, has been built upon many errors; but they are errors which it was good to fall into, for they led to the truth.", "Jules Verne: 1864",
            "*", "Jules Verne: The Great Architect of the universe built it of good stuff.", "Jules Verne: 1864",
            "*", "Jules Verne: The brain is at work without its required food, and the most fantastic notions fill the mind. Hitherto I had never known what hunger really meant.", "Jules Verne: 1864",
            "*", "Jules Verne: Man is so constituted that health is a purely negative state. Hunger once satisfied, it is difficult for a man to imagine the horrors of starvation; they cannot be understood without being felt.", "Jules Verne: 1864",
            "*", "Jules Verne: While his heart still beats, while his flesh still moves, I cannot accept that a being endowed with will-power can give in to despair.", "Jules Verne: 1864",

            "*", "Jules Verne: Their remains but the third class, the superstitious. These worthies were not content merely to rest in ignorance; they must know all about things which had no existence whatever.", "Jules Verne: 1865",
            "*", "Jules Verne: They did to others that which they would not they should do to them—that grand principle of immorality upon which rests the whole art of war.", "Jules Verne: 1865",
            "*", "Jules Verne: In spite of the opinions of certain narrow-minded people, who would shut up the human race upon this globe, as within some magic circle which it must never outstep, we shall one day travel to the moon, the planets, and the stars, with the same facility, rapidity, and certainty as we now make the voyage from Liverpool to New York!", "Jules Verne: 1865",
            "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea", "Jules Verne: The human mind delights in grand conceptions of supernatural beings.

            "*", "Jules Verne: We were alone. Where, I could not say, hardly imagine. All was black, and such a dense black that, after some minutes, my eyes had not been able to discern even the faintest glimmer.", "Jules Verne: 1870",
            "*", "Jules Verne: What good would it be to discuss such a proposition, when force could destroy the best arguments?", "Jules Verne: 1870",
            "*", "Jules Verne: The sea is everything. It covers seven tenths of the terrestrial globe. Its breath is pure and healthy. It is an immense desert, where man is never lonely, for he feels life stirring on all sides. The sea is only the embodiment of a supernatural and wonderful existence. It is nothing but love and emotion.", "Jules Verne: 1870",
            "*", "Jules Verne: In the memory of the dead all chronological differences are effaced.", "Jules Verne: 1870",
            "*", "Jules Verne: The Earth does not want new continents, but new men.", "Jules Verne: 1870",
            "*", "Jules Verne: The Nautilus was piercing the water with its sharp spur, after having accomplished nearly ten thousand leagues in three months and a half, a distance greater than the great circle of the earth. Where were we going now, and what was reserved for the future?", "Jules Verne: 1870",
            "*", "Jules Verne: We cannot prevent equilibrium from producing its effects. We may brave human laws, but we cannot resist natural ones.", "Jules Verne: 1870",
            "*", "Jules Verne: Thus ends the voyage under the seas. What passed during that night — how the boat escaped from the eddies of the maelstrom — how Ned Land, Conseil, and myself ever came out of the gulf, I cannot tell.", "Jules Verne: 1870",
            "Fur Country", "Jules Verne: Hobson perceived with some alarm that bears were very numerous in the neighbourhood and that scarcely a day passed without one or more of them being sighted.", "Jules Verne: 1872",
            "Around the World in Eighty Days", "Jules Verne: Everybody knows that the great reversed triangle of land, with its base in the north and its apex in the south, which is called India, embraces fourteen hundred thousand square miles, upon which is spread unequally a population of one hundred and eighty millions of souls.", "Jules Verne: 1873",
            "*", "Jules Verne: It was all very well for an Englishman like [himself] to make [the tour] with a carpet-bag; a lady could not be expected to travel comfortably under such conditions.", "Jules Verne: 1873",
            "*", "Jules Verne: He had won his wager, and had made his journey... To do this he had employed every means of conveyance — steamers, railways, carriages, yachts, trading-vessels, sledges, elephants.", "Jules Verne: 1873",
            "*", "Jules Verne: Truly, would you not for less than that make the tour around the world?", "Jules Verne: 1873",
            "Mysterious Island", "Jules Verne: Better to put things at the worst at first and reserve the best for a surprise.", "Jules Verne: 1874",
            "*", "Jules Verne: Before all masters, necessity is the one most listened to, and who teaches the best.", "Jules Verne: 1874",

            "*", "Jules Verne: ...the world is very learned. What a big book, captain, might be made with all that is known!", "Jules Verne: 1874",
            "*", "Jules Verne: And what a much bigger book still with all that is not known!", "Jules Verne: 1874",
            "*", "Jules Verne: The desire to perform a work which will endure, which will survive him, is the origin of his superiority over all other living creatures here below.", "Jules Verne: 1874",
            "*", "Jules Verne: Civilization never recedes; the law of necessity ever forces it onwards.", "Jules Verne: 1874",
