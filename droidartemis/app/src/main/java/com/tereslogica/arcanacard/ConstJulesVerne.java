            "Journey to the Center of the Earth", "The undulation of these infinite numbers of mountains, whose snowy summits make them look as if covered by foam, recalled to my remembrance the surface of a storm-beaten ocean.", "1864",
            "*", "If I looked towards the west, the ocean lay before me in all its majestic grandeur, a continuation as it were, of these fleecy hilltops.", "1864",
            "*", "I became intoxicated with a sense of lofty sublimity, without thought of the abysses into which my daring was soon about to plunge me.", "1864",
            "*", "But Heaven never sends unmixed grief, and for Professor Liedenbrock there was a satisfaction in store proportioned to his desperate anxieties.", "1864",
            "*", "How many prisoners in solitary confinement become idiots, if not mad, for want of exercise for the thinking faculty!", "1864",
            "*", "To describe my despair would be impossible. No words could tell it. I was buried alive, with the prospect before me of dying of hunger and thirst.", "1864",
            "*", "Science, my lad, has been built upon many errors; but they are errors which it was good to fall into, for they led to the truth.", "1864",
            "*", "The Great Architect of the universe built it of good stuff.", "1864",
            "*", "The brain is at work without its required food, and the most fantastic notions fill the mind. Hitherto I had never known what hunger really meant.", "1864",
            "*", "Man is so constituted that health is a purely negative state. Hunger once satisfied, it is difficult for a man to imagine the horrors of starvation; they cannot be understood without being felt.", "1864",
            "*", "While his heart still beats, while his flesh still moves, I cannot accept that a being endowed with will-power can give in to despair.", "1864",
            "Earth to the Moon", "Now when an American has an idea, he directly seeks a second American to share it.", "1865",
            "*", "In America, all is easy, all is simple; and as for mechanical difficulties, they are overcome before they arise.", "1865",
            "*", "The moon, by her comparative proximity, and the constantly varying appearances produced by her several phases, has always occupied a considerable share of the attention of the inhabitants of the earth.", "1865",
            "*", "Their remains but the third class, the superstitious. These worthies were not content merely to rest in ignorance; they must know all about things which had no existence whatever.", "1865",
            "*", "They did to others that which they would not they should do to them—that grand principle of immorality upon which rests the whole art of war.", "1865",
            "*", "In spite of the opinions of certain narrow-minded people, who would shut up the human race upon this globe, as within some magic circle which it must never outstep, we shall one day travel to the moon, the planets, and the stars, with the same facility, rapidity, and certainty as we now make the voyage from Liverpool to New York!", "1865",
            "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea", "The human mind delights in grand conceptions of supernatural beings. And the sea is precisely their best vehicle, the only medium through which these giants (against which terrestrial animals, such as elephants or rhinoceroses, are as nothing) can be produced or developed.", "1870",
            "*", "Whoever calls himself Canadian calls himself French.", "1870",
            "*", "This forcible abduction, so roughly carried out, was accomplished with the rapidity of lightning. I shivered all over. Whom had we to deal with? No doubt some new sort of pirates, who explored the sea in their own way. Hardly had the narrow panel closed upon me, when I was enveloped in darkness.", "1870",
            "*", "We were alone. Where, I could not say, hardly imagine. All was black, and such a dense black that, after some minutes, my eyes had not been able to discern even the faintest glimmer.", "1870",
            "*", "What good would it be to discuss such a proposition, when force could destroy the best arguments?", "1870",
            "*", "The sea is everything. It covers seven tenths of the terrestrial globe. Its breath is pure and healthy. It is an immense desert, where man is never lonely, for he feels life stirring on all sides. The sea is only the embodiment of a supernatural and wonderful existence. It is nothing but love and emotion.", "1870",
            "*", "In the memory of the dead all chronological differences are effaced.", "1870",
            "*", "The Earth does not want new continents, but new men.", "1870",
            "*", "The Nautilus was piercing the water with its sharp spur, after having accomplished nearly ten thousand leagues in three months and a half, a distance greater than the great circle of the earth. Where were we going now, and what was reserved for the future?", "1870",
            "*", "We cannot prevent equilibrium from producing its effects. We may brave human laws, but we cannot resist natural ones.", "1870",
            "*", "Thus ends the voyage under the seas. What passed during that night — how the boat escaped from the eddies of the maelstrom — how Ned Land, Conseil, and myself ever came out of the gulf, I cannot tell.", "1870",
            "Fur Country", "Hobson perceived with some alarm that bears were very numerous in the neighbourhood and that scarcely a day passed without one or more of them being sighted.", "1872",
            "Around the World in Eighty Days", "Everybody knows that the great reversed triangle of land, with its base in the north and its apex in the south, which is called India, embraces fourteen hundred thousand square miles, upon which is spread unequally a population of one hundred and eighty millions of souls.", "1873",
            "*", "It was all very well for an Englishman like [himself] to make [the tour] with a carpet-bag; a lady could not be expected to travel comfortably under such conditions.", "1873",
            "*", "He had won his wager, and had made his journey... To do this he had employed every means of conveyance — steamers, railways, carriages, yachts, trading-vessels, sledges, elephants.", "1873",
            "*", "Truly, would you not for less than that make the tour around the world?", "1873",
            "Mysterious Island", "Better to put things at the worst at first and reserve the best for a surprise.", "1874",
            "*", "Before all masters, necessity is the one most listened to, and who teaches the best.", "1874",
            "*", "An energetic man will succeed where an indolent one would vegetate and inevitably perish.", "1874",
            "*", "Man is never perfect, nor contented.", "1874",
            "*", "It is a great misfortune to be alone, my friends; and it must be believed that solitude can quickly destroy reason.", "1874",
            "*", "Men, however learned they may be, can never change anything of the cosmographical order established by God Himself.", "1874",
            "*", "...the world is very learned. What a big book, captain, might be made with all that is known!", "1874",
            "*", "And what a much bigger book still with all that is not known!", "1874",
            "*", "The desire to perform a work which will endure, which will survive him, is the origin of his superiority over all other living creatures here below.", "1874",
            "*", "Civilization never recedes; the law of necessity ever forces it onwards.", "1874",
            "*", "He who is mistaken in an action which he sincerely believes to be right may be an enemy, but retains our esteem.", "1874",
