            "*", "\"Now, my dears,\" said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, \"you may go into the fields or down the lane, but don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden: your Father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor.\"", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "Then old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella, to the baker's. She bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail, who were good little bunnies, went down the lane to gather blackberries.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "After losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that I think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket. It was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "Then he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he became more and more puzzled. Presently, he came to a pond where Mr. McGregor filled his water-cans. A white cat was staring at some gold-fish; she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "THE TALE OF BENJAMIN BUNNY", "One morning a little rabbit sat on a bank. He pricked his ears and listened to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "A gig was coming along the road; it was driven by Mr. McGregor, and beside him sat Mrs. McGregor in her best bonnet.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "Old Mrs. Rabbit was a widow; she earned her living by knitting rabbit-wool mittens and muffetees. She also sold herbs, and rosemary tea, and rabbit-tobacco.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "They went away hand in hand, and got upon the flat top of the wall at the bottom of the wood. From here they looked down into Mr. McGregor's garden. Peter's coat and shoes were plainly to be seen upon the scarecrow, topped with an old tam-o-shanter of Mr. McGregor's.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "Peter did not eat anything; he said he should like to go home. Presently he dropped half the onions.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "[He] said that it was not possible to get back up the pear-tree, with a load of vegetables. He led the way boldly towards the other end of the garden. They went along a little walk on planks, under a sunny red-brick wall.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "When old Mr. Bunny had driven the cat into the green-house, he locked the door. Then he came back to the basket and took out [his son] by the ears, and whipped him with the little switch.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "When Peter got home, his mother forgave him, because she was so glad to see that he had found his shoes and coat. Cotton-tail and Peter folded up the pocket-handkerchief, and old Mrs. Rabbit strung up the onions and hung them from the kitchen ceiling, with the rabbit-tobacco.", "Beatrix Potter",

            "*", "[They] simply stuffed lettuces. By degrees, one after another, they were overcome with slumber, and lay down in the mown grass.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "[They] slept delightfully in the warm sun. From the lawn beyond the garden came the distant clacketty sound of the mowing machine. The blue-bottles buzzed about the wall, and a little old mouse picked over the rubbish among the jam pots.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "Mr. McGregor looked down after emptying his sack. He saw some funny little brown tips of ears sticking up through the lawn mowings. He stared at them for some time.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "Mrs. Tittlemouse was a resourceful person. She nibbled a hole in the bottom corner of the sack. The little rabbits were pulled out and pinched to wake them.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "But next Christmas Thomasina Tittlemouse got a present of enough rabbit-wool to make herself a cloak and a hood, and a handsome muff and a pair of warm mittens.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "THE ROLY-POLY PUDDING", "Once upon a time there was an old cat, called Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit, who was an anxious parent. She used to lose her kittens continually, and whenever they were lost they were always in mischief!", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "The cupboard door was not locked, so they pushed it open and came out. They went straight to the dough which was set to rise in a pan before the fire.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "Ribby and Tabitha set to work to search the house thoroughly again. They poked under the beds with Ribby's umbrella, and they rummaged in cupboards.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "\"Oh! Mother, Mother, there has been an old man rat in the dairy. A dreadful 'normous big rat, Mother; and he's stolen a pat of butter and the rolling-pin.\"", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "Now this is what had been happening to Tom Kitten, and it shows how very unwise it is to go up a chimney in a very old house, where a person does not know his way, and where there are enormous rats.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "THE TALE OF MR. TOD", "The rabbits could not bear him; they could smell him half a mile off. He was of a wandering habit and he had foxey whiskers; they never knew where he would be next.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "One day he was living in a stick-house in the coppice, causing terror to the family of old Mr. Benjamin Bouncer. Next day he moved into a pollard willow near the lake, frightening the wild ducks and the water rats.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "Tommy Brock was a short bristly fat waddling person with a grin; he grinned all over his face. He was not nice in his habits. He ate wasp nests and frogs and worms; and he waddled about by moonlight, digging things up.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "Now Tommy Brock did occasionally eat rabbit-pie; but it was only very little young ones occasionally, when other food was really scarce. He was friendly with old Mr. Bouncer; they agreed in disliking the wicked otters and [him]; they often talked over that painful subject.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "The little rabbit-babies were just old enough to open their blue eyes and kick. They lay in a fluffy bed of rabbit wool and hay, in a shallow burrow, separate from the main rabbit hole. To tell the truth: old Mr. Bouncer had forgotten them.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "There was not much difficulty in tracking him; he had left his foot-mark and gone slowly up the winding footpath through the wood. Here he had rooted up the moss and wood sorrel. There he had dug quite a deep hole for dog darnel; and had set a mole trap. A little stream crossed the way. Benjamin skipped lightly over dry-foot; the badger's heavy steps showed plainly in the mud.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "Great was old Mr. Bouncer's relief and Flopsy's joy when Peter and Benjamin arrived in triumph with the young family. The rabbit-babies were rather tumbled and very hungry; they were fed and put to bed. They soon recovered.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "THE TALE OF MRS. TIGGY-WINKLE", "Once upon a time there was a little girl called Lucie, who lived at a farm called Little-town. She was a good little girl: only she was always losing her pocket-handkerchiefs!", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "Lucie scrambled up the hill as fast as her stout legs would carry her; she ran along a steep path-way: up and up: until Little-town was right away down below: she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney!", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "Some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water: but the water was already running over, for the can was no bigger than an egg-cup! And where the sand upon the path was wet: there were foot-marks of a VERY small person.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "The [she] made tea: a cup for herself and a cup for Lucie. They sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another. [Her] hand, holding the tea-cup, was very very brown, and very very wrinkly with the soap-suds; and all through her gown and her cap, there were HAIR-PINS sticking wrong end out; so that Lucie didn't like to sit too near her.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "THE TALE OF GINGER & PICKLES", "Now the meaning of \"credit\" is this: when a customer buys a bar of soap, instead of the customer pulling out a purse and paying for it: she says she will pay another time.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "The customers came in crowds every day and bought quantities, especially the toffee customers. But there was always no money; they never paid for as much as a pennyworth of peppermints.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "\"It is very unpleasant, I am afraid of the police.\" \"It is your own fault for being a terrier; _I_ do not require a licence, and neither does Kep, the Collie dog.\"", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "\"It is very uncomfortable, I am afraid I shall be summoned. I have tried in vain to get a licence upon credit at the Post Office. The place is full of policemen. I met one as I was coming home.\"", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "They did accounts. They added up sums and sums, and sums. \"Samuel Whiskers has run up a bill as long as his tail; he has had an ounce and three-quarters of snuff since October.\"", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "After a time they heard a noise in the shop, as if something had been pushed in at the door. They came out of the back parlour. There was an envelope lying on the counter, and a policeman writing in a note-book!", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "There was a rush upon the opening day. The shop was crammed with customers, and there were crowds of mice upon the biscuit canisters.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "THE STORY OF MISS MOPPET", "She ties him up in the duster, and tosses it about like a ball. But she forgot about that hole in the duster; and when she untied it: there was no Mouse! He has wriggled out and run away; and he is dancing a jig on the top of the cupboard!", "Beatrix Potter",
            "THE TALE OF MR. JEREMY FISHER", "... he lived in a little damp house amongst the buttercups at the edge of a pond. The water was all slippy-sloppy in the larder and in the back passage.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "[He] put on a macintosh, and a pair of shiny goloshes; he took his rod and basket, and set off with enormous hops to the place where he kept his boat.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "Then he settled himself cross-legged and arranged his fishing tackle. He had the dearest little red float. His rod was a tough stalk of grass, his line was a fine long white horse-hair, and he tied a little wriggling worm at the end.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "A GREAT big enormous trout came up: ker-pflop-p-p-p! with a splash: and it seized [him] with a snap, \"Ow! Ow! Ow!\": and then it turned and dived down to the bottom of the pond!", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "[He] bounced up to the surface of the water, like a cork and the bubbles out of a soda water bottle; and he swam with all his might to the edge of the pond.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "And instead of a nice dish of minnows: they had a roasted grasshopper with lady-bird sauce; which frogs consider a beautiful treat; but I think it must have been nasty!", "Beatrix Potter",
            "THE TALE OF TIMMY TIPTOES", "Once upon a time there was a little fat comfortable grey squirrel... He had a nest thatched with leaves in the top of a tall tree; and he had a little squirrel wife called Goody.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "Every day they made several journeys and picked quantities of nuts. They carried them away in bags, and stored them in several hollow stumps near the tree where they had built their nest.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "When these stumps were full, they began to empty the bags into a hole high up a tree, that had belonged to a wood-pecker; the nuts rattled down: down: down inside.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "They did collect quantities: because they did not lose them! Squirrels who bury their nuts in the ground lose more than half, because they cannot remember the place.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "The most forgetful squirrel in the wood was called Silvertail. He began to dig, and he could not remember. And then he dug again and found some nuts that did not belong to him; and there was a fight. And other squirrels began to dig,: the whole wood was in commotion!", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "But when the other squirrels heard that song, they rushed upon [him] and cuffed and scratched him, and upset his bag of nuts. The innocent little bird which had caused all the mischief, flew away in a fright!", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "She did not put any more nuts into the woodpecker's hole, because she had always doubted how they could be got out again. She hid them under a tree root; they rattled down, down, down. Once when Goody emptied an extra big bagful, there was a decided squeak; and next time Goody brought another bagful, a little striped Chipmunk scrambled out in a hurry.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "\"IT is getting perfectly full-up down-stairs; the sitting-room is full, and they are rolling along the passage; and my husband, Chippy Hackee, has run away and left me. What is the explanation of these showers of nuts?\"", "Beatrix Potter",
            "THE PIE AND THE PATTY-PAN", "And then she thought that did not look quite polite; so she scratched out \"isn't mouse\" and changed it to \"I hope it will be fine,\" and she gave her letter to the postman.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "\"It is all ready to put into the oven. Such lovely pie-crust; and I put in a little tin patty-pan to hold up the crust; and I made a hole in the middle with a fork to let out the steam: Oh I do wish I could eat my own pie, instead of a pie made of mouse!\"", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "Ribby in the meantime had received Duchess's answer, and as soon as she was sure that the little dog would come: she popped HER pie into the oven. There were two ovens, one above the other; some other knobs and handles were only ornamental and not intended to open. Ribby put the pie into the lower oven; the door was very stiff.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "\"It is a pie of the most delicate and tender mouse minced up with bacon. And I have taken out all the bones; because Duchess did nearly choke herself with a fish-bone last time I gave a party. She eats a little fast: rather big mouthfuls. But a most genteel and elegant little dog infinitely superior company to Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.\"", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "Then she began to set the room in order, for it was the sitting-room as well as the kitchen. She shook the mats out at the front-door and put them straight; the hearth-rug was a rabbit-skin. She dusted the clock and the ornaments on the mantelpiece, and she polished and rubbed the tables and chairs.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "Then she spread a very clean white table-cloth, and set out her best china tea-set, which she took out of a wall-cupboard near the fireplace. The tea-cups were white with a pattern of pink roses; and the dinner-plates were white and blue.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "Ribby met Duchess half-way own the street, also carrying a basket, covered with a cloth. They only bowed to one another; they did not speak, because they were going to have a party.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "As soon as Duchess had got round the corner out of sight: she simply ran! Straight away to Ribby's house! Ribby went into the shop and bought what she required, and came out, after a pleasant gossip with Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "\"It is a very odd thing that Ribby's pie was NOT in the oven when I put mine in! And I can t find it anywhere; I have looked all over the house. I put MY pie into a nice hot oven at the top.\"", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "\"How fast Duchess is eating!\" thought Ribby to herself, as she buttered her fifth muffin. The pie-dish was emptying rapidly! Duchess had had four helps already, and was fumbling with the spoon.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "THE TALE OF JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK", "Her sister-in-law, was perfectly willing to leave the hatching to some one else, \"I have not the patience to sit on a nest for twenty-eight days; and no more have you, [...]. You would let them go cold; you know you would!\"", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "She determined to make a nest right away from the farm. She set off on a fine spring afternoon along the cart-road that leads over the hill. She was wearing a shawl and a poke bonnet.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "She flew beautifully when she had got a good start. She skimmed along over the tree-tops until she saw an open place in the middle of the wood, where the trees and brushwood had been cleared.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "\"But as to a nest: there is no difficulty: I have a sackful of feathers in my wood-shed. No, my dear madam, you will be in nobody's way. You may sit there as long as you like,\" said the bushy long-tailed gentleman.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "[She] was rather surprised to find such a vast quantity of feathers. But it was very comfortable; and she made a nest without any trouble at all.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "He was so polite, that he seemed almost sorry to let [her] go home for the night. He promised to take great care of her nest until she came back again next day.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "\"Madam, I beg you not to trouble yourself with a bag; I will provide oats. But before you commence your tedious sitting, I intend to give you a treat. Let us have a dinner-party all to ourselves!\"", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "While she was inside she heard pattering feet round the back of the shed. Some one with a black nose sniffed at the bottom of the door, and then locked it.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "THE TALE OF PIGLING BLAND", "Chin-chin was already in disgrace; it was washing day, and he had eaten a piece of soap. And presently in a basket of clean clothes, we found another dirty little pig. \"Tchut, tut, tut! whichever is this?\"", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "(Aunt Pettitoes passed round the handkerchief again), \"beware of traps, hen roosts, bacon and eggs; always walk upon your hind legs.\" He was a sedate little pig, looked solemnly at his mother, a tear trickled down his cheek.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "[They] trotted along steadily for a mile [...]. Alexander made the road half as long again by skipping from side to side. He danced about and pinched his brother, singing, \"This pig went to market, this pig stayed at home, This pig had a bit of meat\"", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "\"What's that, young sirs? Stole a pig? Where are your licences?\" said the policeman. They had nearly run against him round a corner. [He] pulled out his paper; Alexander, after fumbling, handed over something scrumply\"", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "To conclude the adventures of Alexander: the policeman sauntered up to the house about tea time, followed by a damp subdued little pig. I disposed of Alexander in the neighbourhood; he did fairly well when he had settled down.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "The hamper containing six fowls and a young pig was no light weight; it was taken down hill, unsteadily, with jerks. Pigling, although nearly scratched to pieces, contrived to hide the papers and peppermints inside his clothes.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "[He] slept like a top. In the morning Mr. Piperson made more porridge; the weather was warmer. He looked to see how much meal was left in the chest, and seemed dissatisfied, \"You'll likely be moving on again?\"", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "A perfectly lovely little black Berkshire pig stood smiling beside him. She had twinkly little screwed up eyes, a double chin, and a short turned up nose.", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "A funny old mother pig lived in a stye, and three little piggies had she; (Ti idditty idditty) umph, umph, umph! and the little pigs said, wee, wee!", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "Those three little piggies grew peaky and lean, and lean they might very well be; For somehow they couldn't say umph, umph, umph! and they wouldn't say wee, wee, wee! For somehow they couldn't say...", "Beatrix Potter",
            "*", "He was afraid to go to sleep himself; for the rest of the night he sat listening to the chirping of the crickets and to the snores of Mr. Piperson overhead.", "Beatrix Potter",

            "*", "He put the ham in the middle of the floor, and hit it with the tongs and with the shovel: bang, bang, smash, smash! The ham flew all into pieces, for underneath the shiny paint it was made of nothing but plaster!", "Beatrix Potter",
